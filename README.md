## Hi! I'm James.

I'm a Software Engineer with 4 years of experience developing in Python, C#, and Java. Here‚Äôs a bit more about me:

üî® I build large-scale apps. 
- I've created a social platform with thousands of users.
- I've written algorithms to process thousands of high resolution photos of wildlife for researchers.

üìú I love details and value reliability. 
- I‚Äôve written hundreds of unit and integration tests, and have built several GitHub CI/CD pipelines. 
- Through my machine learning background, I've learned to spot problems from data collection to app deployment.

üíº I get things done. 
- I‚Äôve led nearly 70 developers, designers, and UX researchers across 4 continents on open-source projects.
- I‚Äôve built roadmaps and held Agile meetings to help my teams accomplish over 1,000 Git commits.

üß† I‚Äôm always learning and tinkering. 
- In my free time I explore datasets, build prototypes, and take online courses. 
- I love paying it forward through teaching. I've worked as a teaching assistant and volunteered as a coding mentor at a non-profit.

üê≤ I‚Äôm a communicator. 
- I have a passion for bridging the gap between technical and non-technical audiences; I've written community updates for 2,800+ members.
- I love storytelling, and you might spot me in the evenings doing silly voices for wizards. (Dungeons & Dragons anyone?)

## Recent Projects

### [BLANK Humanity](https://github.com/BLANKHumanity)
I collaborated with my co-owners to design and build a cloud-hosted social platform. We scaled to efficiently store, process, and serve 400,000+ photos and texts, generating 1,600 sales and $220,000 revenue.
									I was in charge of machine learning and testing, and used unit and integration tests to ensure 99% accuracy of our machine learning model and reliable deployment as new data was added.
									I managed 4-5 simultaneous projects using Agile, and communicated technical results to a community of 2,800 users.
<br>
<br>
### [Dev Launchers](https://github.com/dev-launchers/devbots__game)
I founded an open-source project through the non-profit Dev Launchers, building a team of over 60 cross-disciplinary contributors across 8 countries. I operated as Lead Developer, managing 100+ tasks through Git, and producing 602 commits across 3 repositories.
									I built a testing and review framework to handle many contributions, achieving 100% reliability.
									I mentored 19 beginner coders in algorithm design, data structures, and clean code principles, leading to 6 trainees getting their first paid job in the industry.
<br>
<br>
### [Quill To-Do & Calendar](https://github.com/Quill-ToDo/OLD-Rails-App)
I applied test-driven development and Agile to build a to-do list web app with a team of developers, creating 4 iterations based on user feedback and stories.
									I wrote over 60 unit, integration, and functional tests for our model-view-controller architecture with a SQLite relational database backend, achieving 100% code coverage and reliable updates with CI/CD.
									I managed our kanban board and enforced Git standards and usage, which cut meeting times in half and facilitated 384 commits.
<br>
<br>
### [SealNet](https://github.com/jamesdaus/SealNet2)
I created software to identify 400 seals across migration sites without the use of harmful tagging. I planned objectives and resource needs with 3 environmental researchers, then surveyed publications for approaches and built a pipeline to process 2,000+ 4k photos.
									I made and optimized an AWS EC2 and S3 pipeline using C and Python, reducing data loading and training times by 75%, which led to eventual publication covered by 4 news outlets and Smithsonian.
<br>
<br>
### [Code-translation for Accessibility](https://github.com/jamesdaus/NLPAccessibilitySC2)
I created an accesibility program to turn user voice commands into code interpretable by Starcraft 2, which let users control the game without motor function.
									I built a speech-to-code dataset using measurable research approaches, generating over 100 datapoints. I explored and tested various models, resulting in a 112% accuracy increase over my baseline with 90% less code.
<br>
<br>                  
### [Internet Service Provider Policy Summarization](https://github.com/ckjones818/isp-responsibility)
I expanded on past works in computer networks along with my team by scraping Internet Service Provider policy statements and training a Natural Language Processing model to summarize and rate companies. We assembled a dataset of 832 datapoints, helping consumers make informed buying decisions for more than 68 companies.
