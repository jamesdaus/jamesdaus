Hi!

I’m James, a Software Engineer with 4 years of experience developing in Python, C#, and Java. Here’s a bit more about me:

🔨 I build large-scale apps. 
- I've created a social platform with two thousands users.
- I've written algorithms to process thousands of high resolution photos of wildlife for researchers.

📜 I love details and value reliability. 
- I’ve written hundreds of unit and integration tests, and have built several GitHub CI/CD pipelines. 
- Through my machine learning background, I've learned to spot problems from data collection to app deployment.

💼 I get things done. 
- I’ve led nearly 70 developers, designers, and UX researchers across 4 continents on open-source projects.
- I’ve built roadmaps and held Agile meetings to help my teams accomplish over 1,000 Git commits.

🧠 I’m always learning and tinkering. 
- In my free time I explore datasets, build prototypes, and take online courses. 
- I love paying it forward through teaching. I've worked as a teaching assistant and volunteered as a coding mentor at a non-profit.

🐲 I’m a communicator. 
- I have a passion for bridging the gap between technical and non-technical audiences; I've written community updates for 2,800+ members.
- I love storytelling, and you might spot me in the evenings doing silly voices for wizards. (Dungeons & Dragons anyone?)
